Over the years, I’ve struggled with retaining information, especially when preparing for exams or trying to learn new skills. I used to read something once and expect to remember it later, only to realize that most of it had faded from my memory. But everything changed when I discovered the power of revision and recall—two simple yet incredibly effective techniques that transformed my learning process.


The Mistake We All Make:


Like many people, I used to rely on passive learning—just reading, highlighting, and hoping the information would stick. However, studies show that our brain tends to forget new information quickly unless we actively reinforce it. That’s when I started experimenting with a new approach: instead of just reading, I focused on recalling what I had learned without looking at my notes.


The Power of Active Recall :


A couple weeks ago, after studying a topic, I challenged myself to close my book and write down or say out loud everything I could remember. At first, it was difficult. I couldn’t recall much, and it felt frustrating. But after a few attempts, I realized something interesting—each time I tried to recall the information, my memory of it became stronger. This is called active recall, and it’s one of the most powerful ways to make knowledge stick.


Why Repetition Matters:


I also learned that recalling information just once isn’t enough. Our brains are wired to forget things over time (this is known as the forgetting curve ). To beat this, I started using spaced repetition, a technique where I revisited the information at specific intervals—after a few hours, then a day, then a week. The more I practiced recalling, the longer I could retain the information.


How I Apply This Daily:


Here’s the simple method I use now for everything I learn:


1. Learn the material actively – Instead of passively reading, I ask myself questions and engage with the content.
2. Test myself without looking – I try to recall key points without checking my notes.
3. Write or explain it to someone or BE YOUR OWN TEACHER – Teaching to someone or oneself or summarizing helps reinforce what I know.
4. Repeat over time – I revisit the topic at spaced intervals to strengthen my memory.


The Results? A more Confident Me :)


Since adopting this approach, my ability to learn and retain information has skyrocketed. Whether it’s studying for exams, picking up a new skill, or simply remembering important details, I now feel more in control of my learning.


If you’ve been struggling to retain information, give revision and recall a try. It might feel challenging at first, but trust me—once you master it, you’ll never go back to passive learning again!
Happy Happy Learning :D
