# daily-tech-journal
{Daily logs of my journey learning Python, DSA, SQL , Ethical Hacking concepts and many more.}

Welcome to my personal tech journal! ✨  
This is where I document my daily progress as I revisit and brush up on the core concepts of:

 Python Programming  
 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)  
 SQL and Database Concepts  
 Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking (sometimes!)  
 ...and anything else exciting I come across on this learning path!

###  What's Inside?

Each day, I create a new file (e.g., `Day1_Python.md`, `Day2_Arrays.md`) that summarizes what I learned, explored, or revised — written in a **beginner-friendly style**.

I don’t just list definitions — I aim to explain concepts in my own words, with examples, notes, and code snippets I’ve personally tested.  
If you're also learning, revising, or just curious — I hope this helps you too! ❤️

###  Contributions Welcome!

I'm still learning — so if you find something that could be improved, explained better, or corrected:

- Feel free to open a **Pull Request**
- Suggest edits or improvements
- Or just share kind words and feedback 

Let’s learn and grow together.

###  Why I'm Doing This

Learning in public keeps me consistent and intentional.  
This journal is not just a log — it’s a **learning resource**, a **reflection**, and hopefully, a small **contribution** to the tech community.

###  Stay Tuned!

More files coming daily as I dive deeper into:
 Python concepts and best practices
 DSA topics from scratch to advanced
 SQL queries, joins, and database design
 Cybersecurity tricks, tips, and tools
 And lots of “aha!” moments
