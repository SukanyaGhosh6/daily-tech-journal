#  Day 19 â€“ SQL Practice with Nested Subqueries

Welcome to **Day 19** of our SQL learning journey! ðŸš€ Today, we dive deep into **nested subqueries**, one of the most powerful tools in SQL when you want to extract specific data based on conditions related to aggregates, order, or even multiple tables.

Letâ€™s go through 10 practical queries one by one â€” all focused on **employee and department** data â€” and solve them using **nested subqueries**.

---

##  Assumptions

We're working with two main tables:

* **EMP** (with columns: `EMPNO`, `ENAME`, `SAL`, `HIREDATE`, `DEPTNO`)
* **DEPT** (with columns: `DEPTNO`, `DNAME`, `LOC`)

---

### 1. WAQTD 2nd Minimum Salary

```sql
SELECT MIN(SAL) 
FROM EMP 
WHERE SAL > (SELECT MIN(SAL) FROM EMP);
```

 *Explanation*: We first find the **minimum salary**, then fetch the **next higher salary**, which is effectively the **2nd minimum**.

---

### 2. WAQTD 5th Maximum Salary

```sql
SELECT MIN(SAL) 
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT SAL 
  FROM EMP 
  ORDER BY SAL DESC 
  FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY
) AS TOP5;
```

 *Explanation*: We use a subquery to sort and fetch the top 5 salaries, then grab the **minimum** of those â€” i.e., the **5th highest salary**.

---

### 3. WAQTD Name of the Employee Earning 3rd Maximum Salary

```sql
SELECT ENAME 
FROM EMP 
WHERE SAL = (
  SELECT MIN(SAL) 
  FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT SAL 
    FROM EMP 
    ORDER BY SAL DESC 
    FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY
  ) AS TOP3
);
```

 *Explanation*: Similar approach as above, but instead of just the salary, we fetch the employee(s) **with that exact salary**.

---

### 4. WAQTD EMPNO of the Employee Earning 2nd Maximum Salary

```sql
SELECT EMPNO 
FROM EMP 
WHERE SAL = (
  SELECT MAX(SAL) 
  FROM EMP 
  WHERE SAL < (
    SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP
  )
);
```

 *Explanation*: We go one step below the max salary and grab the employee number tied to that.

---

### 5. WAQTD Department Name of an Employee Getting 4th Max Salary

```sql
SELECT D.DNAME 
FROM EMP E 
JOIN DEPT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO 
WHERE E.SAL = (
  SELECT MIN(SAL) 
  FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT SAL 
    FROM EMP 
    ORDER BY SAL DESC 
    FETCH FIRST 4 ROWS ONLY
  ) AS TOP4
);
```

 *Explanation*: Join with `DEPT` to extract the **department name** for the employee with the **4th highest salary**.

---

### 6. WAQTD Details of the Employee Who Was Hired 2nd

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM EMP 
WHERE HIREDATE = (
  SELECT MIN(HIREDATE) 
  FROM EMP 
  WHERE HIREDATE > (
    SELECT MIN(HIREDATE) FROM EMP
  )
);
```

 *Explanation*: Get the **second earliest hire date**, then pull the full employee details.

---

### 7. WAQTD Name of the Employee Hired Before the Last Employee

```sql
SELECT ENAME 
FROM EMP 
WHERE HIREDATE = (
  SELECT MAX(HIREDATE) 
  FROM EMP 
  WHERE HIREDATE < (
    SELECT MAX(HIREDATE) FROM EMP
  )
);
```

 *Explanation*: Get the **hire date just before the most recent one**, and then fetch the name(s).

---

### 8. WAQTD Location of the Employee Who Was Hired First

```sql
SELECT D.LOC 
FROM EMP E 
JOIN DEPT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO 
WHERE E.HIREDATE = (
  SELECT MIN(HIREDATE) FROM EMP
);
```

 *Explanation*: Join with the department table to get the **location** for the **earliest hired employee**.

---

### 9. WAQTD Details of the Employee Earning 3rd Minimum Salary

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM EMP 
WHERE SAL = (
  SELECT MAX(SAL) 
  FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT SAL 
    FROM EMP 
    ORDER BY SAL ASC 
    FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY
  ) AS LOW3
);
```

 *Explanation*: Extract the **3rd lowest salary**, then fetch the full employee data for that salary.

---

### 10. WAQTD DNAME of Employee Getting 2nd Maximum Salary

```sql
SELECT D.DNAME 
FROM EMP E 
JOIN DEPT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO 
WHERE E.SAL = (
  SELECT MAX(SAL) 
  FROM EMP 
  WHERE SAL < (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP)
);
```

 *Explanation*: One level down from the top salary, and a join to fetch the **department name**.

##  Summary

Nested subqueries are a powerful way to isolate data based on aggregate logic like "Nth highest/lowest" or temporal conditions like "hired second." Theyâ€™re especially useful when ranking or filtering data without relying on analytic functions.
