#  Day 13 - SQL Practice Journey

Hey everyone!  
Today was a power-packed day of SQL practice.  
I worked mainly with `WHERE` clauses, logical operators, and special operators.  
I also created two basic employee tables to test all the queries.

Let's dive into everything I practiced today:

---

## Setting Up The Tables

First, I created two simple tables: `employee1` and `employee2`.  
Hereâ€™s what they looked like:

### Table: `employee1`

| eid | ename  | deptno |
|:---:|:------:|:------:|
| 1   | Smith  | 10     |
| 2   | Allen  | 20     |
| 3   | King   | 40     |
| 4   | Turner | 60     |
| 5   | Scott  | 10     |

### Table: `employee2`

| empno | ename  | salary | job        |
|:-----:|:------:|:------:|:----------:|
| 1     | Smith  | 80000  | Salesman   |
| 2     | Allen  | 40000  | Clerk      |
| 3     | King   | 1000000| Testing    |
| 4     | John   | 35000  | CEO        |
| 5     | Deb    | 300000 | Developer  |

# ðŸ§  SQL Assignments I Practiced

---

**Q1. List all the employees whose commission is NULL.**

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE COMM IS NULL;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE MGR IS NULL;
```

```

---

**Q5. List all the employees whose name starts with 'S' or 'A'.**

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME LIKE 'S%' OR ENAME LIKE 'A%';

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE MGR IN (SELECT EMPNO FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=10);
```

---

**Q9. List all the employees whose commission is NULL and working as clerk.**

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE COMM IS NULL AND JOB='CLERK';
```

---

**Q10. List all employees without a reporting manager in Dept 10 or 30.**

---

**Q11. List all the salesmen in Dept 30 with salary more than 2450.**

```

---

**Q12. List all the analysts in Dept 20 with salary greater than 2500.**

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB='ANALYST' AND DEPTNO=20 AND SAL>2500;
```

---

**Q13. List all employees whose name starts with 'M' or 'J'.**

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME LIKE 'M%' OR ENAME LIKE 'J%';
```

---

**Q14. List all employees with annual salary except those working in Dept 30.**

```sql
SELECT ENAME, SAL*12 AS ANNUAL_SAL FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO != 30;
```

---

**Q15. List employees whose name does not end with 'ES' or 'R'.**

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME NOT LIKE '%ES' AND ENAME NOT LIKE '%R';
```

---

**Q16. List employees with reporting managers in Dept 10 along with 10% hike in salary.**

```sql
SELECT ENAME, SAL, SAL*1.10 AS HIKE_SAL FROM EMP WHERE MGR IN (SELECT EMPNO FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=10);
```

---

**Q17. Display salesmen having 'E' as second-last character and salary with exactly 4 digits.**

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB='SALESMAN' AND ENAME LIKE '%E_' AND SAL BETWEEN 1000 AND 9999;
```

---

**Q18. Display employees who joined after year '81.**

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE > TO_DATE('31-DEC-1981','DD-MON-YYYY');
```

---

**Q19. Display employees who joined in February.**

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'MM') = '02';
```

---

**Q20. List employees NOT working as Manager and Clerk in Dept 10 and 20 with salary between 1000 and 3000.**

# Final Thoughts

Todayâ€™s session gave me a lot of hands-on practice with:

- **NULL checks**
- **Pattern Matching (LIKE, NOT LIKE)**
- **Range searches (BETWEEN)**
- **Logical combination of conditions (AND, OR, NOT)**

Honestly, writing all these queries manually really helped in remembering the syntax and understanding the flow of SQL better.  
Feeling much more confident now.

see ya tomorrow!!
